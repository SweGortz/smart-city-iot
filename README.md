## Getting Started

To test the application we recommend that you download it from [google play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.gortz.greeniot.smartcityiot) and then follow the [usage guide in the wiki](https://github.com/SweGortz/SmartCityIoT/wiki/Usages-guide)

### Prerequisites

To be able to modify the application we recommend that you use the official IDE for Android: [Android studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html).

The application requires a google maps API key to be started. How to get the key and where it should be placed can be found in the following [gudie](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-api/signup)

### Installing

1. Run the applicaiton on a [virtual device or your own phone through Android studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/index.html)
2. Download the application from [Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.gortz.greeniot.smartcityiot)
